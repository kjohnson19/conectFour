# Conect Four

# Description
I have created my version of Connect Four. Two players are able to input their name and begin a new game. Player 1 and player 2 take turns attempting to "connect four". Whichever player connects four first wins the game and can then start a new game.

# Future Features
In phase 2 of my version of Connect Four,  I would implement a functioning Ai for the computer player. I would also alternate the first player to move. Lastly, I would implement a "tie" function to the Connect Four score board.
