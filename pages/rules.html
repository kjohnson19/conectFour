 <h3> Description: </h1>

<p> 
This game is played on a vertical board which has seven hollow
columns and six rows. Each column has a hole in the upper part 
of the board, where pieces are introduced. There is a window
for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides.
In short, itÂ´s a vertical board with 42 windows distributed in
6 rows and 7 columns. Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces 
(like coins); each of them uses a different colour. 
The board is empty at the start of the game.
</p>

<h3> Objective: </h3>
        
<p>The aim for both players is to make a straight line of 
four own pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.

<h3> How to win: </h3>

<p>Before starting, players decide randomly which of them will 
be the beginner; moves are made alternatively, one by turn.
Moves entails in placing new pieces on the board; pieces slide
downwards from upper holes, falling down to the last row or 
piling up on the last piece introduced in the same column. 
So, in every turn the introduced piece may be placed at most
on seven different squares. The winner is the first player 
who gets a straight line made with four own pieces and no 
gaps between them.
